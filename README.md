# Bet on Better
The charity website “Bet on Better” is to create an e-Information about the donor and organization that are
related to donations. Through this application any person who is interested in donating the can register himself.
The project consists of users who will register through registration form, the fundraising events section to
participate in them, the donation page where the donor will be given the authority to do payment via credit
card or debit card. This website concentrates on raising money for animal welfare, covid frontline workers,
growing plants and for donating in the memory of the loved ones. We have also added online shop where users
can buy the customized products. The money generated from online shopping will be added to the funds.
