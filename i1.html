Being the first and youngest girl to win this award from India in the Adult category, its a huge honour for me to receive this award !! Thank you to the entire Jury and WPY team."<br><br>C Sukumaran, Director, Consumer System Products & Imaging Communication Products of Canon, said,<br>“We are delighted to hear the news of Aishwarya becoming the first Indian woman to win at the 56th Wildlife Photographer of the Year in the adult category which witnesses tough competition year on year. We want to congratulate her on her win and hope to witness her winning many more such awards in the future.”<br><br>“This is a proud day for Canon as the image that won the award was shot using the EOS-1D X Mark II and at the heart of this camera is a Canon developed CMOS sensor that marks the next generation of professional image quality. This recognition not only serves as an impetus to further motivate the youth of our country into taking up photography professionally but also serves as a testament to Canon’s commitment to propagating the photography culture in the country, along with promoting and nurturing talents,”<br><br>The announcement was made on October 13 at the Natural History Museum in London.Well, we are proud of her and we hope this is an inspirational tale for budding female photographers. </p>
