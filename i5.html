          <h1>World Humanitarian Day: Celebrating the #RealLifeHeroes</h1>

       <hr style="top: 890px;">
       <p class="main">The overwhelming majority of humanitarians around the world are local people.Most often it is members of affected communities who are the first responders. This World Humanitarian Day, let’s celebrate, support and empower local humanitarian workers: women, men, and young people working to meet the needs of their communities.<br><br>Yashma Singh from Palwal district, Haryana, India, has always been a champion in her community for the rights of women and marginalised people. During the coronavirus pandemic, she has promoted information about social distancing in public spaces and door-to-door, including distributing sanitisers and face masks. She has also provided door-to-door food distributions, particularly for migrant workers who could not work due to the lockdown but also had no family support in the area. With the help of several people and organisations, she distributed 15-day rations to 2,000 families.<br><br>Humanitarian workers’ responsibilities do not stop when they get home. They also balance domestic and caring duties on top of their stressful and life-saving day jobs. This is especially true for women working in the humanitarian sector who are usually also the ones responsible for household chores and childcare, among other responsibilities.<br><br>Local communities and individuals are best placed to understand and respond to the needs of their own communities when disaster strikes. They need to be empowered with funding, increased roles in decision making and autonomy in implementing humanitarian responses. Women and girls, in particular, are best placed to know what they need from the humanitarian community to respond to their situation of displacement and now to COVID-19.</p>
